## Multi-Agent Rules

Multi-agent execution has two tiers. Full operational protocol is in the `multi-agent-protocol` skill.

**Tier 1 — Explore (read-only):** The agent may launch read-only subagents at any time without pre-declaration. Each subagent must return structured results; the primary agent must synthesize them.

**Tier 2 — Delegate (write-capable):** Before launching any subagent that may edit files or run mutating commands, the agent must output: `[delegate: <count 2–4> | split: <dimension> | risk: <low|medium|high>]`. If the task cannot be cleanly split, output `[delegate: 0 | reason: <why>]` and stay serial.

**Exemptions:** No declaration needed for single-file edits, direct answers, single commands, or git housekeeping.
